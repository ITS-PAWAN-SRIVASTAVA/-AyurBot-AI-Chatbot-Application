Formulations like Rajarajaeshwari Ras and Kumaryasava are commonly suggested in Ayurveda.These recommendations are sourced from ancient Ayurvedic texts like Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. A commonly used synonym for Amenorrhea in Ayurveda is \u0027Artavakshaya\u0027. For relief, you might consider Hormone replacement therapy and Fertility medications as suggested drugs. Ayurvedic pharmacological properties include a Madhura (sweet) taste, Snigdha (unctuous) qualities, Shita (cold) potency, and Madhura (sweet) Vipaka."
