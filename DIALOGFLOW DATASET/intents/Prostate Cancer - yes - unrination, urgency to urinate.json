            "Thank you for sharing. Based on your symptoms, Prostate Cancer, known as \u0027Ashthi Arbuda\u0027 in Ayurveda, may be a concern. In Ayurveda, recommended herbs include Ashwagandha and Tulsi. The ancient Ayurvedic texts like Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita provide insights into managing Prostate Cancer. Its pharmacological properties include a Tikta (bitter) taste, Guru (heavy) qualities, Ushna (hot) potency, and Katu (pungent) Vipaka. For relief, you might consider Cisplatin and Tamoxifen as suggested drugs."
